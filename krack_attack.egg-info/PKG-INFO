# KRACK Attack Tool

![ezgif-1-4a9174721e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce56522-7a00-49be-926d-a4c9fb6cb3f1)

An implementation of the Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK) against WPA2 as described in the paper "Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2" by Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens.

## Features

- Implementation of all major KRACK attack variants:
  - 4-way handshake attack (plaintext and encrypted retransmission)
  - Group key handshake attack (immediate and delayed installation)
  - Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake attack
- Automatic attack mode:
  - Continuously scans for vulnerable networks
  - Prioritizes targets by signal strength
  - Automatic client detection
  - Tries all attack variants
  - Detailed success tracking and reporting
- User-friendly CLI interface with:
  - Network scanning and target selection
  - MAC address validation
  - Progress indicators and colored output
  - Detailed error reporting
- Cross-platform support (Linux and macOS)
- Comprehensive test suite

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Root/sudo privileges (for network interface access)
- Linux or macOS operating system
- Wireless network interface that supports monitor mode

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slapglif/KrakPoC
cd krack-attack
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure your wireless interface supports monitor mode:
```bash
sudo airmon-ng
```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
sudo python3 krack_cli.py
```

With specific options:
```bash
sudo python3 krack_cli.py --interface wlan0 --ap-mac 00:11:22:33:44:55 --client-mac aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
```

Auto attack mode:
```bash
sudo python3 krack_cli.py --interface wlan0 --min-signal -70 --attack-timeout 300 --scan-interval 60
```

Options:
- `-i, --interface`: Network interface to use
- `--ap-mac`: Target AP MAC address
- `--client-mac`: Target client MAC address
- `--scan/--no-scan`: Enable/disable network scanning
- `--min-signal`: Minimum signal strength for auto attack mode (default: -70 dBm)
- `--attack-timeout`: Timeout for each attack attempt in auto mode (default: 300 seconds)
- `--scan-interval`: Interval between network scans in auto mode (default: 60 seconds)

## Attack Types

1. **4-Way Handshake (Plaintext)**: Exploits plaintext retransmissions of message 3
2. **4-Way Handshake (Encrypted)**: Exploits encrypted retransmissions of message 3
3. **Group Key (Immediate)**: Attacks APs that install group keys immediately
4. **Group Key (Delayed)**: Attacks APs that delay group key installation
5. **Fast BSS Transition**: Attacks the Fast BSS Transition (FT) handshake
6. **Auto Attack**: Automatically tries all attack types on available networks

### Auto Attack Mode

The auto attack mode continuously scans for networks and attempts to exploit them based on:
- Signal strength (configurable minimum threshold)
- Client availability (for attacks that require clients)
- Network vulnerability to different attack types

Features:
- Prioritizes networks with stronger signals
- Automatically detects and targets connected clients
- Tries all applicable attack types on each target
- Maintains a record of successful attacks
- Provides real-time progress updates
- Generates a comprehensive attack summary

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python3 -m pytest test_krack_attack.py -v
```
all tests passing
